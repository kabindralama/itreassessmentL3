        The Amazon rainforest, Amazon jungle or Amazonia is a moist broadleaf tropical rainforest in the Amazon biome that covers most of the Amazon 
        basin of South America. This basin encompasses 7,000,000 km2 (2,700,000 sq mi), of which 5,500,000 km2 (2,100,000 sq mi) are covered by the rainforest. 
        This region includes territory belonging to nine nations and 3,344 formally acknowledged indigenous territories. The majority of the forest is contained 
        within Brazil, with 60% of the rainforest, followed by Peru with 13%, Colombia with 10%, and with minor amounts in Bolivia, Ecuador, French Guiana, 
        Guyana, Suriname, and Venezuela. Four nations have "Amazonas" as the name of one of their first-level administrative regions, and France uses the name 
        "Guiana Amazonian Park" for its rainforest protected area. The Amazon represents over half of the planet's remaining rainforests, and comprises the 
        largest and most biodiverse tract of tropical rainforest in the world, with an estimated 390 billion individual trees divided into 16,000 species.
        More than 30 million people of 350 different ethnic groups live in the Amazon, which are subdivided into 9 different national political systems and 
        3,344 formally acknowledged indigenous territories. Indigenous peoples make up 9% of the total population with 60 of the groups remaining largely

        Angkor Wat; meaning "Temple City" is a temple complex in Cambodia and is the largest religious monument in the world, on a site measuring 162.6 hectares 
        (1,626,000 m2; 402 acres). Breaking from Shaiva tradition of previous kings, Angkor Wat was dedicated to Vishnu for the Khmer Empire. Angkor Wat was 
        built by the Khmer King Suryavarman II in the early 12th century in Yaśodharapura (Khmer: យសោធរបុរៈ, present-day Angkor), the capital of the Khmer Empire, 
        as his state temple and eventual mausoleum. Angkor Wat combines two basic plans of Khmer temple architecture: the temple-mountain 
        and the later galleried temple. It is designed to represent Mount Meru, home of the devas in Hindu mythology: within a moat more than 5 kilometres 
        (3 mi) long[4] and an outer wall 3.6 kilometres (2.2 mi) long are three rectangular galleries, each raised above the next. At the centre of the temple 
        stands a quincunx of towers. Unlike most Angkorian temples, Angkor Wat is oriented to the west; scholars are divided as to the significance of this. T
        he temple is admired for the grandeur and harmony of the architecture, its extensive bas-reliefs, and for the numerous devatas adorning its walls.
        As the best-preserved temple at the site, Angkor Wat is the only one to have remained a significant religious centre since its foundation. 
        The temple is at the top of the high classical style of Khmer architecture. It is one of the most important pilgrimage sites for Buddhists in Cambodia 
        and around the world, having played a major role in converting Cambodia into a Buddhist nation.[6] It has become a symbol of Cambodia, appearing 
        on its national flag, and is the country's main tourist attraction.

        The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications that were built across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial 
        China as protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were built from as early as the 7th century BC, with 
        selective stretches later joined together by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains. 
        Later on, many successive dynasties built and maintained multiple stretches of border walls. The best-known sections of the wall were built by the 
        Ming dynasty (1368–1644).

            Neuschwanstein Castle is a 19th-century historicist palace on a rugged hill above the village of Hohenschwangau near Füssen in southwest Bavaria, 
            Germany. The palace was commissioned by King Ludwig II of Bavaria as a retreat and in honour of Richard Wagner. Ludwig chose to pay for the palace 
            out of his personal fortune and by means of extensive borrowing, rather than Bavarian public funds. Construction began in 1869, but was never fully 
            completed. The castle was intended as a private residence for the King, until he died in 1886. It was open to the public shortly after his death. 
            Since then more than 61 million people have visited Neuschwanstein Castle. More than 1.3 million people visit annually, with as many as 6,000 per 
            day in the summer.

            Iceland is a Nordic island country in the North Atlantic Ocean and the most sparsely populated country in Europe. Iceland's capital and largest 
            city is Reykjavík, which (along with its surrounding areas) is home to over 65% of the population. Iceland is the biggest part of the Mid-Atlantic 
            Ridge that rises above sea level, and its central volcanic plateau is erupting almost constantly. The interior consists of a plateau characterised 
            by sand and lava fields, mountains, and glaciers, and many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream 
            and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle. Its high latitude and marine influence keep summers chilly, and 
            most of its islands have a polar climate.

            Singapore, officially the Republic of Singapore, is a sovereign island country and city-state in maritime Southeast 
            Asia. The country's territory is composed of one main island, 63 satellite islands and islets, and one outlying 
            islet, the combined area of which has increased by 25% since the country's independence as a result of extensive 
            land reclamation projects. It has the third highest population density in the world. With a multicultural population 
            and recognising the need to respect cultural identities of the major ethnic groups within the nation, Singapore has 
            four official languages: English, Malay, Mandarin, and Tamil. English is the lingua franca and numerous public services 
            are available only in English. Multiracialism is enshrined in the constitution and continues to shape national policies 
            in education, housing, and politics.
